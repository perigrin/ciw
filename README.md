# Ciw

Another wheel that was destined to be re-written. This time a Job/Worker Queue (get it!? Queue => Ciw! Hahaha yeah I suck at names) based on KiokuDB. The goal is eventually to have pluggable message queue frameworks to handle the messaging, but right now we just have the ones I need for the project I'm working on.
